Day I
At this point I have a working app with a component tree that is setup kind of like this (note that this is not a design spec!):
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novinary/Insta-Clone-React/novina-pun/instagram/src/images/InstaClone-componentStructure.jpg)
- Dummy data should be imported to app.js, and then passed as props to each PostContainer.
- Each PostContainer should then be passing data to a CommentSection via props as well.
- The props being passed to each component should be typed checked using propTypes and defaultProps.
- The comment section should add a comment to the post
